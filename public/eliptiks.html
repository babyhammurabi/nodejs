<p>It is the year 3290 CE. The African continent has finally started coming into the world stage again. Aggregating into a centralized confederate in 2700 CE, the continent had began to live up to its long perceived potential, quickly becoming the foremost economy on the planet in only 400 years. Two tribes are dominant In this new arrangement, the Yoruba holding the administrative capital of the continent in the urban metropolis of Lagos, while the Igbo nation have the continent’s technology capital in Enugu city. Still keeping to their tribal affinities, Africans although now a nation, still often have feelings of mistrust amongst their respective sub national groups. There seems to be a special antagonism between the two leading tribes, often playing out In parliament, governance and administration. An insurrection from a tribal leader of the kushitic peoples of Sudan had united the rest of Africa against these two leading sub nations, seeing this as an opportunity to tilt their long held dominance. What first started as riots, and little skirmishes in some regions had plunged the whole continent into a full scale war. This was a conflict beyond any known proportions. Prior to now, Africa had began to set the stage in engineering and civilization, and In this conflict the best arms and technologies were at play. But before we begin, I would like to tell you how this whole thing started. The races of the earth as you know today are intergalactic brothers. They all have a common origin. Although not in this part of the cosmos, Humans had a flourishing civilization in the pleiades before being forced on exile outside of their home due to a war which had engulfed the whole Taurus constellation. The victorious humans had stayed back in Taurus, while the exiled became galactic nomads, until finding the planet earth. They came in waves with the first to settle here being the darker Nations; namely the Kushites, the Abbysinian, the Caribs, the Bantu and the Nok. These darker nations arrived circa 10,000 bc and quickly set up civilizations in Nubia, Egypt, Abyssinia, Olmexico Of Meso-America, and the Nok kingdom in pre colonial Nigeria. Next to come were the red Indians, who preferred a sedentary way of life, forming loose confederates in North and South America. They arrived in 9000 BC. The mongols came in not long after that, choosing to occupy the Asian continent. The last group to arrive the earth, or so we had originally thought, were the people which today form the European nations of the world. They arrived in 4099 BC. They initially had the upper hand in the war at Taurus but it seemed the war had taken another unprecedented turn, with the only darker race left on the mother planet, the sabaeans, the final victors, forcing the white races exile. The sabaean were a people with one king, they were the most technological race. They take their name from the technologies which propelled their civilization. Being the first explorers of the cosmos, they had discovered a pre-eminent force in the universe, they called it the sabe. It is what makes up dark matter, being magnetic in nature. They were not a warring tribe, often using this technology for noble purposes like medicine and spiritual fulfillment. However the Conflict In Taurus had made them more militant. We did think the Europeans were the last to arrive the earth until one unfortunate event. The human civilizations of the earth had quickly redeveloped the ancient technologies, slowly becoming explorers once again on  getting to the earth. The kushites were the new leaders, and in the year 2000 BC, the kushites sought to re-establish contact with any other surviving human groups in the rest of the universe. They sent out electromagnetic messages to other galaxies hoping for any response from taurus. what they got however, was a response not quite anticipated. In the Orion constellation had reigned a humanoid species of the giant types. With mystique technologies these people’s were gifted with strength, girt and clairvoyance. What started as an innocent probe of the galaxies had alerted this superior alien nation to the resource rich green lushes of the planet earth. Being a stealthy group, this giant race had set up bases in the great oceans and mountains of the earth without alerting the local human populations. They studied the human groups for a time, often meddling in human affairs and politics, without notice. Through telepathy, they inspired the earlier religions of the world, creating the first idea of angelic beings as gods and creators. They ruled humans indirectly through this. Humans had originally known the universe to have originated from one creator in a perfect balance of cause and effect, from Allah we came and to him we must return. However the earlier religions taught humans that giant angelic beings had originated the universe. Humans now assumed a subservient state to the giants through religion. The giants were soon found out however, when a leading priest started to question the inerrancy of all the religious texts. Human rebellions forced the giants to show face and the first series of wars on the planet ensued. The white races being very combative and aggressive, quickly won the respect of the giants, capturing many of them and often holding them to a standstill in many wars. The Fulani people of the asiatic kushite were loved by the giants for their musical skills. The Nok used the giants to build great walls to fortify their cities in Benin and ijebu. The white races seemed the smarter of all at the time, negotiating superior technologies with the giants in return for peace. This quickly propelled them to pre-eminence amongst human species. They dominated the other groups, displacing original nations from their continents and settling in the four corners of the planet. Their civilizations started in Greece and Rome, but They quickly consolidated power in Africa, Asia, the caucuses , oceania and the the Indian subcontinent. They journeyed west to the Americas and also displaced the red indians from there. The caribs of the west were also stripped of their knowledge of self and ancient history.
    The giants re-appeared and disappeared from human consciousness every thousand years, their re-emergence often heralding new discoveries, philiosophies and technologies. The European nations had held sway until the great shift in the year 2200 CE when the first sabaean contingent arrived the earth with the prince of sabe. Their arrivals started with multiple sightings of superior alien spacecraft which world governments sought to suppress from the masses. The sabaeans aligned themselves with the other darker races of the earth, sympathizing with their long lost brothers and aiming to end their subservient state on the planet. They had stealthily landed on the mountain of Kilimanjaro, and slowly blended in with the local populations. They held base at Kilimanjaro, and often reported back to base with their findings. They also maintained contact with the home planet at Taurus. 
    The history of pre-colonial Nigeria began when The Nok people first settled the area in 6000 BC. Their first kingdom was Nok. They then dispersed to form the igbo kingdoms, nupe, igala, the plateuas then Ife and Edo. The kushitic Hausa soon entered the area Nigeria and also set up the renowned zaria kingdom. The Nilotic Kanuris were also one of the first to settle pre colonial Nigeria, originating the kanem Borno dynasties. The Benins, Yoruba and Igbo are of Nok origins. 
    The African states however had slowly fallen to European powers due to the superior technologies of Europe, leading to the colonization and formation of synthetic Afrikan states like Nigeria. The emergence of the sabaeans on earth started to tilt power back to Africa with the introduction of anti gravity propelled craft. The sabaeans interacted with all the dark nations of Bantu, kush, Nok and Ethiopia. The Caribs of the Caribbean islands are the Jamaicans and other Caribbean groups who are also dark races, who had originated the Olmec nations, but also suffered defeat by European powers. The sabaeans maintained relations with them, moving large numbers of Caribs into North Africa and displacing the original caucasians there, setting up new civilizations. Africans with the new found technologies slowly started dominating the other nations. They conquered London and Paris in 2300 CE. Madrid and Munich fell in 2350 CE. Africa became the new center of the world. It was once again time for the giants to re-emerge. The war which had engulfed the new Africa was being played out for control of the planet. The hidden protagonists were the sabaeans from Taurus and the giants from Orion. With every global war, a new thought and science would always ensue. The giants preferred the caucasians and mongols, and the sabaeans preferred the Africans and Caribs. The gravity defying technologies of the sabaeans versus the nuclear and atomic technologies of the giants.  </p>
